	The project was originally developed using java and javamail 1.4.4. The main 
	class for this app is the Mailer.java. The mailer takes in a text file 
	that includes the specific details for each recipient (including email, name, 
	major, school, tuition cost, and the sender's name) and the message outline. 
	After reading in all variables in the message, it compiles each unique message 
	and sends them out to its intended recipient.
